# DSA8030_Exploratory-data-analysis-in-R

Core portfolio project: Exploratory data analysis

Project goal: Load a messy dataset into R, clean the data, create 4-5 charts or tables that have summary stats about your data, and create 4-5 charts or tables that provide analytic insight. Your output should be an html rmarkdown document.

Questions to answer: How big is my dataset? What do the top 10 items of data look like? What is the distribution of my variables of interest (mean/median, skew, outliers)? How does data change over time? What is the relationship between Variable A and Variable B? Why does Variable A behave in such and such a manner?
